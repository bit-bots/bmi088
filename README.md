# bmi088 

A rust embedded-hal driver for the 
[Bosch Sensortec BMI088](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/datasheets/bst-bmi088-ds001.pdf)
6DOF integrated accelerometer and gyroscope (IMU).

The BMI088 combines the functionality of two inertial sensors
into one device: a triaxial 16-bit gyroscope 
and a triaxial 16-bit accelerometer.
